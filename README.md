# MAST
This project is an attempt to create scripts to process multiwavelength data and create an working AI to make data vizulaiztion easier though command line based interaction and speech synthesis.

# Usage Guidance
One can directly load image_operations.py to directly view all the functionality.
Only logarithmic stretching is added and will add more in future.
Till now RGB image with same stretch is available. Will add multiple strech options in future.
It can read .fz file extensions too as they are only compressed fits files. 
Image alignment is still not implemented as image alignment is quick and simple using PyRAF. 

MAST integration is still in progress, if you want to try load mast_integration.py 

Till now no ML amd AI is used as basic scripting is not complete yet.
